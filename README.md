## Description

  Nowadays, many trades are done online using e-commerce websites. Because of that reason, essentially they are important aspects of our lives. However, keeping all the data for the end-customer could be tedious because of dealing with the data itself is hard. For this reason, I've created a back-end for an e-commerce website using MySQL2 and Sequelize. Additionally for the test I used Insomnia.

## Installation

  Go to directory of E-Commerce Back-End, open the console and type in 'npm i' to install the packages needed for this application to run. After installing the packages, open MySQL interface and create the database by typing in 'SOURCE db/schema.sql;' and type 'exit' to quit MySQL. After that type in 'npm run seed' to the console of E-Commerce Back-End to seed the database.

## Usage

  After the installation of the packages and seeding, type in 'npm start' to the console, to start the server. The user can use either a web browser or Insomnia app to see the JSON files.
